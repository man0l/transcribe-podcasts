2. Click on `File` > `Open notebook`.
3. Select the `GitHub` tab in the pop-up window.
4. Enter the URL of the GitHub repository containing the project or search for the repository by name.
5. Once you find the repository, click on the notebook file `youtube_transcription_project.ipynb` to open it.
6. After the notebook is loaded, you can run it by clicking on `Runtime` > `Run all` to execute all cells in sequence.

### Notes:

* Make sure you are logged into your Google account to access Google Colab.
* If the notebook requires access to Google Drive files, you may need to mount your Google Drive by following the instructions provided in the notebook.
* You can also upload local files to Colab by clicking on the folder icon in the left sidebar and then on the upload button.
